	\section*{Abstract}

As the world today becomes more and more digitialized and depended on computers for efficiency,
embededded systems have become  increasingly popular. One of the main reasons for this is the
microcontroller, a small computer on a single integrated curcuit. Since microcontrollers are flexible 
and programmable, you can use the same microcontroller in several different embedded systems. Thus reducing
project and product cost, since you do not have to spend time designing a special purpose processor. 

But due to the vast increase of computer usage and the use of computers in extreme environments, power consumption 
and longtivity has become a major challenge within embedded computer design. 


This report covers the second exercise, and builds on the first exercise, in the course TDT4258 Energy Efficient Computer Systems at NTNU. The main goal of this exercise is to use the \textit{the EFM32GG DK3750 development board} to produce sound, by using the boards Digital to Analog Converter (DAC), a timer, and interrupts. This report will guide you through process of creating a simple program that plays different sounds when a button is pressed. We will also present the design choices made in order to minimize the power consumption.
