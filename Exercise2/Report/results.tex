\section{Results}\label{chapter:Results and Tests}

This section covers the testing of the program, the resulting functionality of the program and its power consumption.

\subsection{Result}

\subsubsection{Functionality}
The final version of the program works as follows: when you press one of the leftmost buttons, it will play a sound. The first will play the Star Wars main theme, the second will play a cannon fire, and the third will play a game over sound.

\subsubsection{Power consumption}

Without any power optimizations the program used 5-6 mA. By putting the processor to sleep by using the WFI instruction and enabling deep sleep this number was lowered to 1.5 mA (when sound was not playing). Finally, by disabling the DAC and the LETIMER0 when sound is not playing, the power consumption ended up at 1-3 $\mu$A when no sound is playing and 500-1000 $\mu$A when sound is playing. 

\subsection{Testing}

The testing of the program was either done manually (pressing buttons and observe the result) or with GDB. The general method was testing manually to see if the program did what we intended. If this failed, and there were no obvious reasons for this, we debugged with GDB by reading the values of critical registers. 

Power consumption was tested by reading the energy usage of the board, using the built-in energy meter.
