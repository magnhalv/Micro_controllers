\section{Conclusion}
All of the requirements given by the assignment has been fulfilled. The described program plays three different sound when the first leftmost buttons are pressed. 

We have also designed the program to be as power efficient as possible, by letting the processor deep sleep while waiting for interrupts, using the Low Energy Timer for timing the sampling rate, and disabling any uneccesary power consuming component. 

We tried to improve the energy efficiency of the program by using Direct Memory Access, but failed to do so after having troubles enabling PRS pulses on LETIMER0 output.
