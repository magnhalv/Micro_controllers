\section{Conclusion}

The assignment tasks were: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Configure and build the uClinux for the board.
	\item Make a driver for the buttons. It should be implemented as a kernel module. You are
	free to make the driver as you wish, but the minimum requirements are to support your
	needs for the game to work.
	\item Complete the game. Use the framebuffer driver for writing to the display. Use your own	driver for reading the status of the buttons.
\end{enumerate}

We can conclude that all of the tasks have been completed. In addition we made two more drivers in order to provide a better implementation. Two of the drivers also have support for signaling the user application. All of the drivers allocates resources dynamically and supports virtual memory, making them quite robust. 

We were unfortunantly unable to implement the sound driver, but we still learned a lot by attempting to make it work. 

The game may be a bit simple, and we wish we had more time to work on it, but it still illustrates how a user application can interact with device drivers. More importantly, it illustrates how an user application can interact with \emph{our} device drivers, and that they work. 

All in all, it has been an interesting and highly educating assignment.
