	\section{Abstract}

Operating systems provide an abstraction such that interacting with hardware is made much easier for programmers. However, in order to be able to support the vast amount of hardware available, the operating systems requires device drivers. In this report we will make device drivers for Linux on a EFM32GG to add hardware support for a gamepad. We will also show how device drivers can utilize kernel timers and how they can send signals to user applications in userspace. We will also use these drivers in order to make a simple computer game, that needs to interact with hardware.
