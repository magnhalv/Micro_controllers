\section{Solution}\label{chapter:Solution}
This section covers the solution of the exercise. We continued on the work done in the
previous exercise. This included VHDL files for a MIPS multi cycle processor, that 
simulated well in software, but had some trouble with branching when it came to 
running on an FPGA. The work was mainly in implementing and connecting the different 
pipeline registers with control signals, including the \textit{hazard detection unit}
and the \textit{forwarding unit}.
