\section{Conclusion}
All of the requirements given by the assignment has been fulfilled. The described program allows you to manipulate the LEDs by pressing the buttons on the gamepad. We have also extended the program with extra functionality, which included a more complex LED pattern and changing the pattern on invervals using a countdown timer. Interrupts are activated for both GPIO events and timer events, thus allows the processor to do other operations instead of constantly polling the GPIO and timer. 
We have also designed the program to be as power efficient as possible, by letting the processor sleep while waiting for interrupts and using the Low Energy Timer for countdown timing. 

An improvement that could be made to the program, is removing the use of global values. When keeping track of the number of timer interrupts we save it in register 7, and hope that it will not be used somewhere else in the program. While this works in the programs current state, it is not good design if the program is to be extended with more functionality. 

But we are quite satisfied with the resulting program. Making it have given us a lot of insight on the EF32GG architecture, given us a basis for low-level coding and reasoning, and how to read reference manuals for computer components.
