\subsection{Assignment}
The assignment is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item   Write an assembly program which enables a user to control the LEDs in some way by pressing the buttons.
    \item   Write an interrupt rotuine (an interrupt handler) for reading the buttons.
    \item   Use a Makefile to compile and upload the program to the microcontroller.
    \item   Use the energy monitor to see the power requirements of your program. Analyze and
            discuss (or implement) improvements. 
    \end{itemize}


The solution provided in this report have completed all of the listed conditions, and have also added some extra functionality. In addition to simply using the buttons to control the LEDs, they are also manipulated by interrupts from a countdown timer. This extra functionality will be described in more detail in the following sections.
