\section{Feedback}\label{chapted:assignment_feedback}

We found the assignment very exciting and learned a lot from it. The compendium was very informative and, supported by the student assistent, helped a lot in getting a fundamental understanding of how the system worked. The only complaint we have is that in order to do fulfill the minimum requirement of the assignement, you do not really have to use the reference manual at all. So a possible improvement would be to try to involve the reference manual a bit more directly, since you learn a lot by understanding how to use it.
